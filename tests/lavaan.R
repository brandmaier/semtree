# BE AWARE OF THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF MODEL COMPARISON WITH INCREASES

# SEE PLOT.
# THE PLOT FUNCTION WILL SHOW ALL FREE PARAMETERS AT EACH TERMINAL NODE.
# THIS CAN CREATE UNREADABLE FIGURES FOR MODELS WITH MANY FREE PARAMETERS.

# SEE SUMMARY.
# OVERALL MODEL FACTS ARE GIVEN WITH THE SUMMARY FUNCTION.
