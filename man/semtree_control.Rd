\arguments{
\item{method}{Default: 'naive'. One of
\code{c("score","fair","naive")} for a score-based testing
scheme, an unbiased multi-step selection algorithm, or a naive
take-the-best strategy.}

\item{min.N}{Integer. Default: `NULL` heuristically selects this number based on the number of parameters in the model. Minimum sample size per
node used to determine whether splitting can continue. It is recommended to set `min.N` explicitly.}

\item{max.depth}{Integer. Default: NA. Maximum levels per a branch. Parameter for
limiting tree growth.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Default: 0.05. Significance level for splitting at a given
node.}

\item{exclude.heywood}{Default: TRUE. Reports whether there is an
identification problem in the covariance structure of an SEM tested.}

\item{progress.bar}{Boolean. Default: TRUE. Option to enable or disable the progress
bar for tree growth.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. Default: FALSE. Option to turn on or off \emph{all} model
messages during tree growth.}

\item{bonferroni}{Boolean. Default: FALSE. Correct for multiple tests with Bonferroni
type correction. p-values are adjusted for the number of variables tested.}

\item{use.all}{Boolean. Treatment of missing variables. By default, missing values
stay in a decision node. If TRUE, cases are distributed according to a
maximum likelihood principle to the child nodes.}

\item{seed}{Default: `NA`. Set a random-number seed to make randomized parts
of tree analysis reproducible (for example, in fair splitting or subsampling
procedures).}

\item{custom.stopping.rule}{Default: NA. Otherwise, this can be a boolean
function with a custom stopping rule for tree growing.}

\item{mtry}{Default: NA. Number of sample columns to use in SEMforest
analysis.}

\item{report.level}{Integer. Default: 0. Values up to 99 increase console reporting
detail during tree growth and can help diagnose fitting or split-selection
issues.}

\item{exclude.code}{Default: NA. NPSOL error code for exclusion from model
fit evaluations when finding best split. Default: Models with errors during
fitting are retained.}

\item{linear}{If TRUE (default), the structural equation model is assumed to
not contain any nonlinear parameter constraints and scores are computed
analytically, resulting in a shorter runtime. Only relevant for models fitted
with OpenMx.}

\item{min.bucket}{Integer. Minimum bucket size. This is the minimum size any node
must have, such that a given split is considered valid. Minimum bucket size
is a lower bound to the sample size in the terminal nodes of a tree.}

\item{missing}{Missing value treatment. Default is ignore}

\item{use.maxlr}{Boolean. Use MaxLR statistic for split point selection (as proposed by Arnold et al., 2021). This corrects the bias in the LR statistics incurred by testing multiple split points within one variable.}

\item{strucchange.from}{Strucchange argument. See their package
documentation.}

\item{strucchange.to}{Strucchange argument. See their package documentation.}

\item{strucchange.nrep}{Strucchange argument. See their package
documentation.}

\item{refit}{If TRUE (default) the initial model is fitted on the data
provided to \code{\link{semtree}}.}

\item{ctsem_sd}{If FALSE (default) no standard errors of CT model parameters
are computed. Requesting standard errors increases runtime.}

\item{loglik}{Character.Character. Algorithm to compute log likelihood. `"default"`
depends on the chosen SEM package: `"mvn"` for lavaan and `"model"` for
all other packages. `"model"` refers to model-based computation and is more
general. `"mvn"` computes likelihood from the multivariate normal density
using model-implied means and covariance matrices.
multivariate normal density and the model-implied mean and covariance matrix.}

\item{check.convergence}{Boolean. Should convergence be checked when growing a tree. Default: TRUE}

\item{chunk.random.samples}{Integer. Controlling split-point subsampling for
`method = "naive"`. `0` (default) evaluates all eligible split points.
Values `> 0` evaluate random chunks of split points, which can speed up tree
growth on very large datasets at the cost of a less exhaustive search.}

\item{Numeric.}{alpha.invariance Default: NA. Significance level for invariance
tests. If NA, the value of alpha is used.}
}
\value{
A control object containing a list of the above parameters.
}
\description{
A \code{semtree_control} object contains parameters that determine the tree
growing process. These parameters include choices of different split
candidate selection procedures and hyperparameters of those. Calling the
constructor without parameters creates a default control object. A number of
tree growing methods are included in with this package: 1. 'naive' splitting
takes the best split value of all possible splits on each covariate. 2.
'fair' selection is so called because it tests all splits on half of the
data, then tests the best split value for each covariate on the other half
of the data. The equal footing of each covariate in this two phase test
removes bias from testing variables with many possible splits compared to
those with few. 3. "fair3" does the phases described above, with an
additional step of retesting all of the split values on the best covariate
found in the second phase. Variations in the sample from subsetting are
removed and bias in split selection further reduced. 4. 'score'
implements modern score-based statistics.

	# create a control object with an alpha level of 1\%
	my_control <- semtree_control(alpha=0.01)

	# set the minimum number of cases per node to ten
	my_control$min.N <- 10
	
	# print contents of the control object
	print(my_control)
