\title{Aggregate Variable Importance Estimates}
\usage{
aggregateVarimp(
  vimp,
  aggregate = c("mean", "median"),
  scale = c("absolute", "relative.baseline"),
  omit.na = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aggregate}{Character. Either 'mean' or 'median' as function to aggregate estimates over a forest}

\item{scale}{Character. Either 'absolute' or 'relative'.}

\item{omit.na}{Boolean. By default TRUE, which ignores NA estimates when aggregating. Otherwise they are interpreted as zero.}
}

This function aggregates variable importance estimates over
trees. It is a helper function used when print() is called
on a variable importance estimate from a SEM forest.
