Description: SEM Trees and SEM Forests -- an extension of model-based decision
    trees and forests to Structural Equation Models (SEM). SEM trees hierarchically
    split empirical data into homogeneous groups sharing similar data patterns
    with respect to a SEM by recursively selecting optimal predictors of these
    differences. SEM forests are an extension of SEM trees. They are ensembles of 
    SEM trees each built on a random sample of the original data. By aggregating over 
    a forest, we obtain measures of variable importance that are more robust than 
    measures from single trees.
